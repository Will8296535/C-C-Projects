Socket-based TCP/IP communications chat program<br>
Language: C. System: Linux<br>
This is a chat program to demonstrate the basics of socket-based TCP/IP communications. The system is comprised of 2 applications - the server and the client. The server is multi-threaded. A new thread will be created each time a new user joins the conversation. This thread will be responsible for accepting incoming messages from the user and broadcasting them to the other chat users. The client application is written in ANSI C and will make use of the ncurses library in order to facilitate the multiple windows.<br>
